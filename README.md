# SwampDragon

## Help needed, and the future of SwampDragon

SwampDragon has a lot of dependencies, and is heavily dependent on Django.
One of the libs that SwampDragon is dependant on is [https://github.com/leporo/tornado-redis](https://github.com/leporo/tornado-redis), and this project looks like it might no longer be maintained (I believe Leporo has done a great job with this library and I understand that he may no longer have time to maintain it)
Going forward I have decided that this needs a solution.

So the current plan for SwampDragon is this:

*  Remove as many external dependencies as possible
*  Make it work with other frameworks like Flask etc. (i.e remove Django as a required dependency)
*  Better testing 
*  More code coverage
*  Swappable serializer (it should be possible to use 3rd party serializers like that of DRF)
*  SelfPublishModel needs rewriting and should be a separate module
*  ... and much more
*  Proper contribution guidelines
  
### How to get there

This is a big job and help is required to get there.
Anything from writing code and tests to reviewing PRs etc. would be appreciated.

If you are interested in helping out let me know.
